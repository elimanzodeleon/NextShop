# Next Shop

This is a full stack web application powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) that uses server-side rendering.

[Demo](https://next-shop-bice.vercel.app/).

If testing app functionality, use card information:

- card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- expiration date: 04/24
- cvc: 424
- name: ANY
- zip: ANY

## Motivation

I decided to build this full stack Ecommerce web app to strengthen my full stack development skills using server-side rendering. The past projects I have built used client side rendering and I wanted to switch things up a bit and learn about server-side rendering.

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a framework I have been wanting to learn and this project was a good place to start. I plan on building more web apps using Next.js so that I could strengthen my skills with this framework.

## Front End

The front end was built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/).

## Back End

The back end was built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), and [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/). [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) was used to handle all user payments.

#### TODO

- add search functionality
- allow all users to post and sell items (similar to eBay, grailed, etc)
